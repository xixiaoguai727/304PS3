# Read in the raw data (You might need to change this if you use a different dataset)

raw_data <- labelled::to_factor(raw_data)
# Just keep some variables

reduced_data <- reduced_data[(reduced_data$vote_2020 == 1|reduced_data$vote_2020 ==2),]
#### What else???? ####
# Maybe make some age-groups?
# Maybe check the values?
# Is vote a binary? If not, what are you going to do?
